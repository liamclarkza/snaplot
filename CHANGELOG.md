## [Unreleased]

## [0.5.0] - 2026-04-18

### Breaking
- `ZoomConfig.wheelFactor` renamed to `ZoomConfig.wheelStep`, with new
  semantics: it is now the zoom fraction per max wheel / pinch tick
  rather than a scale factor. Default changes from `1.1` (10 % per
  tick) to `0.1` (same 10 % per tick, stated directly). `0` disables
  wheel zoom. Negative values are clamped to 0. Migration:
  `wheelFactor: 1.1` → `wheelStep: 0.1`, `wheelFactor: 2` → `wheelStep: 1`.

### Added
- Biome 2.4 for lint + format (`npm run lint`, `npm run check`).
- Vitest for unit tests (`npm test`), initial suites for
  `data/binarySearch`, `scales/niceNumbers`, `config/merge`.
- Lefthook pre-commit + pre-push hooks.
- `.github/workflows/quality.yml` running lint + typecheck + tests + builds on PRs.
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` documenting dev workflow and release process.

### Fixed
- **Security**: `TooltipManager.defaultRender` now HTML-escapes series labels,
  formatted values and colour strings. A series named `<img src=x onerror=…>`
  no longer executes.
- **Stability**: one throwing event listener no longer stops the render loop
  or other subscribers on the same event (`ChartCore.emitEvent` is now wrapped
  in try/catch with console logging).
- **Performance**: histogram tooltip bin lookup uses `upperBound` instead of
  a linear scan, O(log n) vs O(n). Meaningful for charts with many bins.

### Changed
- Dropped unused `chartRef` and two `as any` casts in `legendPlugin`.
- Dropped an `as any` cast in `legendTablePlugin` (setOptions accepts
  `DeepPartial` already).
- Legend plugin click handler now re-reads `chart.getOptions()` each
  invocation so stale closures can't reference outdated series indices.
